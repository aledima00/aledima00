# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Alessandro!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a 24-year-old Master's student in *Computer Engineering* at the Politecnico di Torino (Italy), specializing in **AI and Data Analytics**. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for **Web Development**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**. Here on GitHub, I love sharing projects and contributing to the open-source community.

## ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, JavaScript (client & Node), Python, and recently picking up Rust ðŸš€
- **Web Development**: Expert in crafting modern, responsive web applications with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend.
- **AI & ML**: Skilled in deep learning and custom neural network architectures using **PyTorch**. I also use **TensorFlow** for working with popular pre-trained models.
- **Microcontrollers & Embedded Systems**: Experienced in **C** programming for devices like STM32, Arduino, and ARM Cortex-M3.
- **Databases**: Proficient with **SQL databases** (Oracle, MySQL) and **NoSQL databases** like MongoDB.
- **Big Data**: Familiar with **MapReduce for Hadoop** and **Spark** for handling large datasets.
- **OS**: I grew up with Windows and i know every inch about it, but then I've also embraced Linux and understood why it is so popular amongst developers.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
- **Evolutionary Algorithms & Computational Intelligence** â€“ Exploring how nature-inspired algorithms can solve complex problems.
- **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking** â€“ Enhancing my skills in security, pentesting, and ethical hacking techniques.
- **Rust** â€“ Diving into Rust as a modern, safe alternative to C++, and I'm really enjoying its performance and safety features.

## ðŸ“ˆ What Drives Me
Creating efficient and user-friendly web applications, developing custom AI solutions, and pushing the limits of what I can achieve with code are my top priorities. I am an **open-source enthusiast** and i love finding inspiration from others here on GitHub!
